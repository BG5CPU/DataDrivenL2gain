
## Instructions

``DistillationColumn.m`` simulates the noise free case and noisy case;  
set `ed` and `ew` as zero, then the simulation is for noise free case;  
set `ed` or `ew` as none zero,  then the simulation is for noisy case;  
``DistillationNoisefree1.mat`` is simulation result for noise free case;  
``DistillationNoise1.mat`` is simulation result for noisy case.


``DistillationColumnNoise.m`` simulates the noisy case for a number of independent datasets (Monte Carlo simulations);  
``DistillationNoiseSequence1.mat`` is the corresponding results.

``DistillationColumnTandD.m`` explores the relationship between performance and noise energy;   
``DistillationTandD1.mat`` is the corresponding results.

You can load ``.mat`` data files to save your time.
